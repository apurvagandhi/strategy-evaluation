# Code implementing a ManualStrategy object (your Manual Strategy) in the strategy_evaluation/ directory. 
# It should implement testPolicy() which returns a trades data frame (see below). 
# The main part of this code should call marketsimcode as necessary to generate the plots used in the report. 
# NOTE: You will have to create this file yourself.
